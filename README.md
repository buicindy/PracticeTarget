Practice Target for Software Carpentries GitHub Workshop

We will practise creating issues on github! This is the same function shown with screenshots in [checkout instructions for lesson contribution](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout#what-is-an-issue-github-101).

➡️ **Create an issue** to change the `apple` you are assigned to `banana`.

For example, your issue might read: `change apple0 to banana0`.

: apple1

: apple2

: apple3

: apple4

: apple5

: apple6

: apple7
